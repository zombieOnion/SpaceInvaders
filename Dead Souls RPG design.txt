Dead Souls RPG design

Vad har en karaktär för mängd Hit Points?
Vad gör en karaktär för skada i antal Hit Points?
Hur fungerar "armor"?
Hur fungerar status effects?
Hur beräknar man hur långt en karaktär kan gå?
Ska vissa kunna hoppa över hinder?

Character archetypes? Mix of archetypes?
Archetypes help people understand what they classes are doing, and provide some base in a fantasy world they don't recognize. More advanced classes can be added later.

Base classes:
	
	Tanks
		Receive and somehow manage taking damage
		Fat armor, magical defences, hard to hit, parry? All different ways to manage received damage.
	Healers
		Magical healing (lay-on-hands, zagovor)
		Physical healing (herbs, bandages, oils etc)
	Damagers
		Melee DPS: martial arts, big weapons, magic
		Ranged DPS: muskets, bows, crossbows, magic
	Buffers/Debuffers
		Magical effects: cripple, bless, blind, bad luck

What I want:
	Classes that aren't "only good for one thing"
	Abilities may have secondary, tertiary effects. This will allow for certain roles to overlap, and hopefully make gameplay more emergent and complex.

Status effects to consider:
	Stun - character immobilized by pain or chock. Can lose grip/footing?
	Knock-out - character loses consciousness, falls down.
	Sleep - character falls asleep.
	Poison - character takes X damage each round.
	Curse/Evil Eye - character fails any dicerolls, or receives penalties?
	Bound - character cannot move, but can attack/use magic
	Silenced - character cannot use certain magic
	Disarmed - character cannot attack

Abilities and modifiers:
	Attack
		Character uses weapon to attack a target. Can be ranged or melee.
	Leap
		Character leaps over otherwise impassable terrain. Maybe have as passive ability?
	Leap Attack
		Character leaps to a unoccupied square near a target, and strikes that target. Bonus damage gets added.
	Pushback
		Character pushes target away from self. Push distance may vary based on character strength and target size (small targets go further)
		Targets can be pushed off a ledge down into an abyss, deep water, or a trap.
		Certain attacks are Pushbacks but also deal damage.
	Vault Over
		Character vaults over an target or an obstacle, lands behind it.
		Vault Attack is when a character vaults over a target and strikes it from above.
	Parry
		Character uses weapon to deflect an incoming melee (or ranged?) attack. Can avoid taking damage alltogether.
	Block
		Character uses shield to absorb an incoming melee or ranged attack. Damage can still be received by character.
